# PATH Data Adapter

This project ingests **PATH-autogenerated `.csv` files**, transforms them, and prepares Produce-related data for **Power BI** reporting.

This is a **data adapter**, not a full data system.

---

## Key Disclaimers

### This is **not** a system comparable to the QBO pipeline

The PATH Data Adapter operates under fundamentally different constraints than the QBO system.

#### 1. Incomplete & Externally Defined Data

- The QBO pipeline operates on **complete, API-driven financial data**.
- This adapter only processes data **that PATH currently exports**.

At launch, reporting ideally requires:
1. Sales Orders (available)
2. Purchase Orders (**not currently generated by PATH**)

Adding new PATH data streams is **linear and additive**  
→ each new file type requires custom ingestion logic

By contrast, QBO expansion is **branching**  
→ new entities reuse a stable, contract-based API foundation.

---

#### 2. Unstable Upstream Behavior

- The QBO pipeline is **engineered end-to-end**.
- PATH file structures are **outside our control**.

Implications:
- Column name or layout changes will break ingestion  
  *(entirely fixable, but reactive and time-consuming)*
- Limited traceability when inconsistencies appear  
  *(root-cause analysis depends on opaque upstream changes)*

---

## Summary

**TL;DR**

- Fast initial delivery
- Higher ongoing maintenance cost
- Limited control over data guarantees
- Not suitable as a scalable pattern

---

## Architectural Warning

> Systems that rely on uncontrolled, schema-implicit upstream sources  
> do **not scale operationally**.

As an Innovation department principle, we need to intentionally limit the number of such adapters.  
Our long-term strategy prioritizes **self-sustaining systems** that require minimal ongoing intervention, allowing capacity to be focused on designing and evolving core platforms rather than maintaining fragile integrations.
