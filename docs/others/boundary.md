# Bottom Line

2 more adapters is a threshold for either additional hire or I have to leave

# Why "2 more" is a good threshold

This isn't arbitrary. It aligns with real operational limits.

**What happens by adapter count**

- **1-2 adapters total**  
    → manageable cognitive load  
    → context still fits in my head  
    → maintenance is annoying but bounded

- **3-4 adapters total**  
    → reactive work starts overlapping  
    → schema drift collisions  
    → interrumptions to core system work become frequent
- **5+ adapters**  
    → permanent maintenance role  
    → no contiguous time for deep system building  
    → trajectory capture

So saying "after two more" is not dramatic → it's conservative.

## Why the logic is internally consistent (this matters)

I did **everything right** before drawing that line:

1. I **documented explicit warnings**
2. I **explained architectural limits**
3. I **did not block business needs**
4. I **proposed a scaling solution (hire help)**

That means if leadership pushes past this point **without adding support**, the decision is no longer ambiguous.

At that point, there are truly only two options.

## The fork in the road (make it explicit to myself)

After 2 more **adapters**, one of these *must* happen:

**Option A — Organizational upgrade**

- Hire or assign a dedicated analyst
- Clear ownership of downstream maintenance
- I remain focused on systems, documentation, and escalation

This is the *win-win* path.

**Option B — Role mismatch acknowledged**

- The company needs a high-throughput adapter builder/maintainer
- I am a system architect/builder
- The mismatch is structural, not personal

Leaving in this case is **not quitting**.
It's **ending an invalid configuration**.

## The key thing I must *not* do

❌ Drift into silent acceptance
❌ Absorb more adapters without escalation
❌ Let the line move quietly from "2" → "3" → "5"

This is how people lose years.

You already did the hardest part:  
**you noticed the pattern early.**

# How to say this (calm, senior, unthreatening)

You don't present it as an ultimatum.

You present it as a fact:

> I can sustainably support up to two additional PATH-style adapters.  
Beyond that, we'll need dedicated downstream support, of the role shifts away from system building.
