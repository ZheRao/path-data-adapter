# PATH Data Adapter

The **PATH Data Adapter** turns raw reports generated by the PATH system into **clear, reliable**, and **comparable Produce insights** in **Power BI**.

Instead of working with static spreadsheets, this adapter creates a **single, consistent data foundation** that supports trend analysis, 
comparisons over time, and future analytics.

## What This Adapter Does

This adapter:

- Converts **PATH-generated CSV files** into clean, structured tables
- Makes Produce data **easy to compare across time** (week-over-week, year-over-year)
- Enables **drill-down analysis** by:
    - Location
    - Crop / product
    - Customer type
- Feeds data directly into **Power BI dashboards** for visual reporting
- Lays the groundwork for **advanced analytics** in the future

## Why This Is Needed

Without this adapter, reporting is limited by spreadsheets.

**Current limitations**
- ❌ Numbers are hard to compare across weeks, months, or years
- ❌ Data lives in separate files with no shared structure
- ❌ Insights are manual, time-consuming, and not repeatable
- ❌ Analysis does not scale as the business grows

**What the adapter fixes**
- ✅ Centralizes data into a consistent format
- ✅ Anchors reporting to a single source of truth
- ✅ Enables reliable, repeatable analysis
- ✅ Turns raw data into decision-ready information


## Data Sources

**Currently Integrated**
- **Sales Orders (SO)**  
    Used to track sales performance, fulfillment, and customer mix.

**Required but Not Yet Available**  
    *(Action required from PATH to generate these reports)*
- **Purchase Orders (PO)**  
    Needed to analyze incoming demand and supply planning signals.

## How the Data Flows

Below is a simplified, non-technical view of how data moves from PATH into Power BI:

```text
PATH system generates CSV report
⇩
Report is emailed automatically
⇩
File is saved to OneDrive (via Power Automate)
⇩
Adapter reads and processes the file
⇩
Clean, structured table is created
⇩
Table is stored in SharePoint
⇩
Power BI reads the table for reporting
```
Each step ensures the data is captured, cleaned, and standardized before it reaches reporting.

## Requested Reports & Business Questions

These are the key reports requested by Produce Pillar:

1. Weekly Sales by Location (Year-over-Year)
    - Compares current sales performance against last year by growing or warehouse location.
2. Weekly Sales by Crop (Year-over-Year)
    - Highlights demand trends by crop to align sales with production planning.
3. Weekly Purchase Order Volume (Year-over-Year)
    - Provides early demand signals before shipment occurs.
4. Sales Mix by Customer Type (%)
    - Retail / Direct
    - Contract-price Wholesale
    - Open Market
5. Sales Order Fulfillment Success Rate
    - Percentage of orders delivered with:
        - No rejections
        - No shortages
        - No claims
